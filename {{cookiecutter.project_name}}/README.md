## Description

{{cookiecutter.short\_description}}

***

## Installation

> **Edit:** you should add to this section the instructions to install the package.
> The following steps work with the default package generated by `cookiepy`.

You can install *{{cookiecutter.friendly\_name}}* via pip:

```console
$ pip install {{cookiecutter.project_name}}
```

That command installs the package in your local Python environment.
However, during development you might want to consider installing it in **development mode**.
You can do so by adding the `-e` option the installation command:

```console
$ pip install -e .
```

> You can learn more about the differences between `pip install` and `pip install -e`
> commands at: [pip documentation - development-mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development\_mode.html#development-mode)

### Python Environment

When installing the *{{cookiecutter.friendly\_name}}*, it might be a good idea to install
it in a specific Python environment. By default, *{{cookiecutter.friendly\_name}}*
doesn't restrict the usage of any Python environment managers ([conda](https://www.anaconda.com/),
[venv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), etc.).

For more on how to **create**, **activate**, or **manage** environments, please refer to:

*   [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
*   [virtualenv cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/ilyes64/cheat-sheets/python-virtual-environments/)
*   [poetry cheat sheet](https://vikasz.hashnode.dev/python-poetry-cheatsheet)

> **Edit:** each environment manager has its own ups and downs. I won't start the endless
> discussion on which environment manager is the best here. At the end, it depends on your
> personal preferences. **Having said that, I strongly recommend choosing one and sticking with it.**
> Refer to your teammates to define which tool will be the project's default environment manager.
